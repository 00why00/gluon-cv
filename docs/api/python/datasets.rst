Vision Datasets
===============

.. automodule:: gluonvision.data
.. currentmodule:: gluonvision.data

Popular datasets for vision tasks are provided in gluonvision.
By default, we require all datasets reside in ~/.mxnet/datasets/ in order to have
frustration-free user experience and less path-works.

- For small datasets, such as MNIST, MNIST-fashion and CIFAR-10, we provide pre-defined class for out-of-box usage.
- For larger datasets which require significant time for download/extracting, we provide scripts to ease preparation step.
