Prepare the ImageNet dataset
============================

The `ImageNet <http://www.image-net.org/>`_ project contains millions of images and thounds of objects for image classification. It is widely used in the research community to demonstrate that new proposed models are be able to achieve the state-of-the-art results.

ImageNet contains multiple datasets. The commonly used version to benchmark image classification models is the dataset used in `ILSVRC 2012 <http://www.image-net.org/challenges/LSVRC/2012/>`_. This tutorial will go through how to prepare the ISVRC2012 dataset to be used by GluonVision. 

.. note:: 
   
 Â  You need at least 300 GB disk space to download and extract the dataset. Solid-state disks (SSD) are prefered because of the better performance on read and write small objects (images).
